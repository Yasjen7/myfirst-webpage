# myfirst-webpage
    This project is a professional website that introduces me as an artist and aspiring tech professional. It features a brief and detailed bio, a profile image, my resume link, a collection of my art projects, a podcast episode, and a footer with my social media links. The goal is to give visitors a deeper understanding of my creative journey and professional goals.
